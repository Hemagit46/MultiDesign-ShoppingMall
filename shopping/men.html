                    <p>Cotton short-sleeve shirts were once a fashion crime that screamed ‘blue-collar worker’. Nothing wrong with that,<br>
                         of course, but you don’t want someone you’re meeting for the first time to assume you are their DoorDash delivery guy.<br>
                         The short-sleeve shirt has been reinvented by designers recently.</p>

                         Each fabric brings its own character to the table, but many carry some stereotyping, too, so bear that in mind when using these.</P>

                        <p>Slim fit jeans are typically preferred by skinny men since they aid to elongate their legs. <br>
                            These types of denim jeans fit snugly and have a narrow leg opening. Those who are thin and seek both comfort and style tend to like these</p>

                        <p>These types of denim jeans are different from slim-fit jeans. Yes, please avoid the confusion. <br>
                            From the waist to the ankle, skinny jeans are just that—skinny. <br>
                            These are typically worn as a fashion statement because they don't provide much mobility</p>

                        <p>Pants or jeans that have been intentionally ripped or destroyed are known as ripped jeans. The fabric can be ripped, torn,<br>
                             or frayed to achieve this. As a result of the anarchist fashion craze in the 1980s, these jeans gained popularity.</p>

                        <P>Among the different types of jean fits, your breathing space is increased by the baggy fit of these jeans. <br>
                            As a result, it doesn't adhere to your thighs too tightly when wearing loose pants around the thighs and butt. <br>
                            These will undoubtedly be quite comfy if you have a large waist or large bones.<br>
                             In terms of various male body shapes, loose jeans work best for big-boned males.</P>
